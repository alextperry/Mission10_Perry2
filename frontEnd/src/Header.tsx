            <h1>Welcome to the Marlins vs. Sharks Rivalry Page</h1>
            <h4>
                The rivalry between the Marlins and the Sharks is the stuff of
                bowling alley legend. For over a decade, these two teams have
                battled it out on the lanes, turning every strike, spare, and
                gutter ball into a fierce competition. The Marlins, known for
                their flashy custom bowling shoes and synchronized victory
                dances, pride themselves on precision and flair. Meanwhile, the
                Sharks bring raw power and a no-nonsense attitude, intimidating
                opponents with their signature fin-shaped bowling balls. Their
                head-to-head record is razor-close—out of 47 matchups, the
                Sharks hold a narrow lead with 24 wins to the Marlins’ 23. With
                every face-off, the tension builds as both teams aim to tip the
                scales in their favor and claim ultimate bragging rights. One
                thing’s for sure—when the Marlins and Sharks hit the lanes, no
                pin is safe!
